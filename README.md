I'm experiencing numerous issues with Angular in newer versions of Storybook. It seems they are all related to Compodoc. These issues include:
* Arrays are interpreted as strings
* Enums are not correctly interpreted
* EventEmitters throw errors

I tracked down the version when this started happening and I found out that these issues started to occur in [v6.4.0-alpha.34](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/releases/tag/v6.4.0-alpha.34) (in **v6.4.0-alpha.33** everything is fine). I assume it is related to this pull request:  #15744

### Reproduce:
Clone this repository: https://github.com/decline/storybook-angular-issues

There are 3 stories that describe what is going wrong.

#### See errors in v6.4.0-alpha.34:

```sh
yarn && yarn storybook
```

#### See it working in v6.4.0-alpha.33:

```sh
git checkout 6.4.0-alpha.33
yarn && yarn storybook
```

As soon as you remove the `setCompodocJson(docJson);` line in `.storybook/preview.js` it will also work in v6.4.0-alpha.34, but then you will also lose Compodoc support ðŸ˜•

I also recorded a video that shows the comparison between the two versions:
